## How to go throught modules on best way
1.	Read the module
2.	Practice the exercises
3.	Complete the module
4.	Start the module exercises from scratch
5.	While solving the exercises again, take notes
6.	Create technical documentation based on the notes
7.	Create non-technical documentation based on the notes

After completing the module, we should create minor technical and non-technical documentation (i.e., create sample technical findings and reproduction steps and executive summary entries that could be included in a report). Focus on practicing creating "client-ready" documentation.


## Retired HTB machines 
1.	Get the user flag on your own
2.	Get the root flag on your own
3.	Write your technical documentation
4.	Write your non-technical documentation
5.	Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up if you don't have a VIP subscription
6.	Create a list of information you have missed
7.	Watch Ippsec's walkthrough and compare it with your notes
8.	Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts


## On active machines:
1.	Get the user and root flag
2.	Write your technical documentation
3.	Write your non-technical documentation
4.	Have it proofread by technical and non-technical persons
