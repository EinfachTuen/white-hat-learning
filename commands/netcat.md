## netcat
netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and
writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. The command is designed to be a
dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and
scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation
tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection its user could need and has
several built-in capabilities. Its list of features includes port scanning,
transferring files, and port listening: as with any server, it can be used as a
backdoor.


```bash
nc -h

l : Listening mode.
v : Verbose mode. Displays status messages in more detail.
n : Numeric-only IP address. No hostname resolution. DNS is not being used.
p : Port. Use to specify a particular port for listening.


nc -lvnp 8001
```
