if (END) is blinking: 
The (END) message typically appears when you're using a pager like less or more in the terminal, and you've reached the end of the output.  To continue using the terminal, you can press q to quit the pager and return to the command line. If you want to scroll through the output, you can use the arrow keys or Page Up/Page Down.
