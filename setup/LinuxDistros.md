# Kali Linux:
Based on Debian and has a lot of tools preinstalled. Its a good choice for pentesting and security.
- Kali downloading page https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms

### Setup
It is strongly suggested to use for each Pentest a clean VM to not influence the pentest of another machine / customer.

# Virtualization:
### Free
- Hyper-V *(sometimes a bit clunky when docker is installed)*
- Virtual Box *(works well just the vb tools are hard to reinstall with kali)*
- VMware Workstation player

### Paid
- VMware Workstation *(has a lot of features)*
